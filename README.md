# Figma Design System

A React design system generated from Figma via MCP (Model Context Protocol), following atomic design principles.

## Structure

```

├── tokens/           # Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
├── atoms/            # Basic building blocks
├── molecules/        # Composed of atoms
├── organisms/        # Composed of molecules and atoms
└── __manifests__/    # Component registry and dependencies
```

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Storybook
npm run storybook

# Tests
npm run test
```

## Atomic Design

- **Variables** → Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- **Atoms** → Basic components (buttons, icons, inputs)
- **Molecules** → Composed components (form fields, cards)
- **Organisms** → Complex components (headers, modals, forms)

## Components

### Atoms
- PlaceholderIcon (placeholder for all icons)

### Molecules
- (Coming soon)

### Organisms
